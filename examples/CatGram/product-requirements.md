# Product Requirements Document: <PROJECT_NAME>

## What are we building? 

A photo-sharing social platform specifically designed for cat owners and cat lovers to share, discover, and celebrate cat photos and stories.

## Project Type

Net-new project. 

## Problem to solve

Cat owners love sharing photos of their cats but general social media platforms don't provide cat-specific features or community. Cat content gets lost among other posts, and there's no way to connect with other cat enthusiasts specifically around shared cat interests.

## Project goals

- Create a dedicated space for cat photo sharing
- Build engaging cat-focused community features
- Validate demand for niche pet social platforms
- Establish foundation for future pet-specific social features

## User Types

1. Cat owners who frequently photograph their cats and want to share with other cat lovers
2. Cat enthusiasts who enjoy viewing and engaging with cat content
3. Multi-cat households who want to showcase their different cats
