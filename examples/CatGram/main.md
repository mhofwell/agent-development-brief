# Agent Development Brief for CatGram

Please review the following project documents in the specified order to get a comprehensive understanding of CatGram:

1. product-requirements.md

2. technical-guidelines.md

3. design-requirements.md

4. agent-operating-guidelines.md

5. decision-log.md

**Ask questions to clarify ambiguities, contradictions, or missing critical information. Focus on questions that would impact implementation decisions rather than minor details.**

If an update to a document is necessary after you discuss your questions, you will then update the relevant document to reflect any decisions made.

After reviewing these (and any necessary updates), and asking clarifying questions, create an implementation plan called PROJECT_STATUS.md in the **/agent-development-brief** folder with a list of small testable phases with deliverables. By testable we mean the application should build and run successfully after each phase. You will update PROJECT_STATUS.md after we complete each step or phase.
